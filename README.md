# Fishrc
This project contains my preferred Fish configuration. It tries to be system independent. It will initialize a new Fish Shell using the ``fishrc_reset_config`` command. **Note**: this will remove any universal variables you might have defined.

## Dependencies
* [fish](https://fishshell.com/)
* [tide](https://github.com/IlanCosman/tide)
